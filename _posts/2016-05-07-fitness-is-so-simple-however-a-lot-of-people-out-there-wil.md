Fitness is so simple! However, a lot of people out there will try to convince you otherwise. They'll make you believe you can only get in shape if you use their big shiny expensive machine or some other complicated piece of equipment. They'll have you question your own common sense and convince you that anything and everything you know about fitness is wrong!

Allow me to let you in on a little known secret, all you need are two things to get in shape: something to lift (this can literally be anything including your own body weight) and room to move. That's it! You're covering all the bases! You'll be building strength (anaerobic) and increasing your metabolic conditioning (aerobic). 

Don't believe me? Ok, next time you do the laundry try this one! Here's all the equipment you'll need: A full laundry basket (half full, quarter full, based on what you can lift multiple times) and stairs. You'll be lifting the basket off the floor to your waist using your legs while keeping your back as straight as you can (tightening your core will help). The other part will be running/walking up and down the stairs. Do 5 Rounds of 10 basket lifts and 2 stair runs (up and down counts as one run). This workout can be as manageable or as challenging as you make it. If you want more of a challenge go faster, if not, then go slower. See how you feel when you're finished. If you're not out of breath then you probably didn't push yourself hard enough. 

Do you see my point now? Fitness doesn't have to be complicated. You can get a great workout in the comfort of your home or outside (find an object you can lift or your own bodyweight resistance (Ex: push-ups) and a trail to run/walk on).

Of course, not everyone will achieve the specific results they want from this type of workout. For example, someone training for a specific sport or event will need to train more modalities. However, the point of having a strength component and raising your heart rate should be the two goals of any workout you do. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df666255-de49-4972-a292-bab5586936d5.jpg)
